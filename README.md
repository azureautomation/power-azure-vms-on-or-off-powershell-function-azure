Simple function that will, based on a parameter switch ON/OFF determine if an Azure Virtual Macine is already powered 'on' or 'off' and change the power state of the Virtual Machine to what is specified in the 'power' parameter selected by the user running
 the function. Verbose output can be viewed if the -verbose switch is added at the end of the function. See function examples for more details.

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
